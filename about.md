This is BlockchainOS dev team's technical blog.

Welcome!

### **To start with..**

Bitcoin originated from the cypherpunk movement, which is based on the free flow of ideas.

People interested in the crypto-currency industry enjoy sharing their ideas, knowledge, and value having a highly interconnected global community in the true spirit of the open-source and creative commons philosophies.

Blockchain developers, like most developers, are eager to find, and share their knowledge, and know how.

We, BlockchainOS's dev team, are happy to share our knowledge, know-how, trials, and (sometimes) challenging stories with people all over world. This blog will be stocked full with lots of information, stories, and other information valuable to the crypto-currency enthusiast. 

Please leave your comments. It will give us motivation to do great work.

Thank you.

Regards

BlockchainOS developers
